											<h2>Academic Writing</h2>
											<p>My work as an English major</p>
										</header>
										<p>The english classes that I have taken at St. Joe's have pushed me to write clearly, powerfully, and concisely. Below are some some samples of my academic writing, and on the right side of the page, you'll find descriptions of some of my favorite classes I've taken in college. </p>

										<header>
											<h3>Sample 1: From "Harriett Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin: From Compromise to Abolition"</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Harriet Beecher Stowe’s 1852 novel Uncle Tom’s Cabin is largely a reaction to Congress’ passing of the Fugitive Slave Law in 1850. This law, contested by many throughout the North, made it illegal to harbor runaway slaves in free states, making it almost impossible for slaves to escape their current situations in the South. Throughout Uncle Tom’s Cabin, Stowe employs numerous characters and scenes in order to counter support for the recently passed Fugitive Slave Law and persuade her readers to take a more radical standpoint on the issue of slavery. One such example is the character of George Harris, a young husband, father, and slave whose political arguments for liberty mirror those of abolitionists such as William Lloyd Garrison and Fredrick Douglass. By including George’s extreme viewpoint, his sentimental duty to his family, and his unwillingness to honor the laws of the country that enslaves him, Stowe creates a role model for abolitionist action, which is so strong that it must be slightly curbed at the conclusion of Uncle Tom’s Cabin to remain appealing to an 1852 reader. Through George Harris, Stowe pushes her readers to adopt a more radial position against slavery.</p>
										<p>...George’s highly political reasoning, which frees him from following the laws of the Constitution, also aligns with Douglass’ abolitionist speech “What to the Slave is the Fourth of July?” In this oration, Douglass asks Americans, “What have I, or those I represent, to do with your national independence?” (Douglass 1002). Douglass contends that from the slave’s point of view, the Fourth of July is a reminder of the injustice that is forced upon him from the United States government, which offers no liberties to slaves, but instead leaves the Constitution and the Bible “disregarded and trampled upon” (Douglass 1003). This is the exactly the same injustice that George recognizes in his own life. He expresses his situation in the terms of his white companion when he comments, “I wonder […] if the Indians should come and take you a prisoner away from your wife and children […] if you’d think it your duty to abide in the condition in which you were called” (Stowe 99). George, like Douglass, argues that one can feel no obligation to honor the laws or practices of the country that enslaves, exploits, and abuses him.</p>
										<p>...Stowe’s ultimate goal in writing Uncle Tom’s Cabin is to sway her readers toward a more progressive perspective on the issue of slavery. The passing of the Fugitive Slave Law, which inspired Stowe’s writing, stands in direct opposition to the moral duty Stowe feels that she and all Americans have to the enslaved. As a result, the character of George Harris is meant to serve as a persuasive force to readers as they sentimentally identify with his familial responsibilities, understand his frustration and need for immediate action, and are exposed to his political perspective, which imitates those of Garrison and Douglass. Though George is by far the most extremist character in Uncle Tom’s Cabin, Stowe checks his political and racial radicalism by sending him to Liberia and injecting Christianity into his views. This is to maintain George’s appeal to Stowe’s more moderate audiences. Stowe may limit George’s full political potential as an abolitionist, but his views are undeniably crucial in pulling her readers away from compromise and towards immediate reform. </p>

											<h3>Sample 2: From an additional chapter to Bram Stoker's Dracula </h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											Later.— The deed is done. I thought that it should have felt more significant, but the experience was oddly straightforward. Even the long trip over the Borgo Pass and through the woods that terrorized Dr. Van Helsing and myself just days ago was uneventful and even, dare I say, picturesque in the daylight. Perhaps without Dracula’s presence to cast a shadow over its natural beauty, the area can thrive once again. Even so, I could tell that Jonathan wasn’t well…He tried to keep his grip on my arm light, but at times he unconsciously tightened his grasp, undoubtedly remembering the last time he had approached Dracula’s castle. </p>
	                    <p>The doors that had once kept Jonathan a prisoner were no longer locked, and after a few strong pushes from Lord Godalming and Dr. Seward, they creaked open to reveal the castle’s moldering and dust-covered interior. It seemed ages since anyone had inhabited the place—or inhabited it as a normal human would, I should say. </p>
											<p>Wanting to finish the task as quickly as possible, we split up to cover the castle and search for anything out of the ordinary. While Jonathan, Lord Godalming, and Dr. Seward set out to investigate the majority of the castle, Dr. Van Helsing and I, with Jonathan’s direction, headed for the Count’s library to see if we might find any important papers. </p>
											<p>It was eerie to finally find myself in a place I had read about so extensively. After having pored over Jonathan’s journal when I thought I might be losing him, I felt I was already familiar with the interior of this castle. I found Jonathan’s description highly accurate; there were hardly any personal possessions of the Count’s to be found anywhere. The library contained the books that Jonathan had mentioned, but the only documents that Dr. Van Helsing and I could find were contained in a single drawer. They were legal papers, mainly deeds and documentation of land ownership, but they seemed to be many years old. Dr. Van Helsing continued to search the library for anything we may have missed, but I was intrigued by some of these papers... <p>

												<h3>Sample 3: "Authorative Voice," from a business-style report on content marketing writing</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Industry-Specific Knowledge<p>
<p>Companies that offer a very complex service or compete in a highly specific field often hire content marketers to generate content that will spark interest in their product or service. In order for such content to be successful, it must utilize industry-specific terminology and knowledge in order to build credibility. In content marketing, this ethos can make or break a piece of writing. </p>

<p>Ms. Delaney emphasized the importance of using a detailed, informative style of writing when necessary. “The people in the industry are going to be able to tell whether you know what you’re talking about or not,” she said, “which is why I think working with your client on their pages is so important.”</p>

<p>Reaching out to clients is a highly effective way to gain industry-specific knowledge directly from the source. Instead of repeatedly asking questions of clients whenever they hit a roadblock in their writing, content marketers can take advantage of the “knowledge bank” system, created by John Hall, CEO of Influence & Co. and Content Marketing Institute contributor (Hall, CMI). </p>

<p>Hall recommends that content marketers request that clients build a bank of information that can be referenced at any time. This bank should include company-specific insider information, industry knowledge, and both factual and opinion-based information about the company that can serve as a guide for a content marketer. By integrating this industry information into their content, a content marketer can easily write as if they were an expert in the field. </p>

<p>Establishing Credibility</p>
<p>The better a content marketer can write about industry concepts and ideas and as if they were a master, the more credibility they will gain with their audience. This credibility is crucial—it’s what draws audiences to your content and what will keep them coming back. However, establishing credibility on an unknown topic is not an easy feat.</p>

<p>“Being an authority on a subject is hard,” Ms. Delaney said. “I mean you don’t know it, but you have to know it.” Starting out is difficult, especially when working with a new client in an unknown industry. The best first step is to research. Ms. Delaney recommends using Google Scholar in order to find credible research and the most up-to-date developments in any given field. Be willing to cite these experts—though you may not be an expert yet, openly drawing on the knowledge of those who are will attract readers. </p>

<p>Additionally, your first goal should be to simply break down complex information for your readers. This can put your role in perspective and make your task more manageable. “You might not be the planet’s greatest authority on your topic. But it’s possible for you to become the most accessible authority,” says Sonia Simone, content marketer and CopyBlogger contributor. “Make life better for your customers by taking something hard and making it easy” (Sonia Simone, CopyBlogger). </p>

<p>Ultimately, content marketers who want to become experts must be patient. “The more you do it, the easier it gets,” Ms. Delaney said. “You just get to know the industry terms, but it just comes from working with the same company repeatedly.”</p>

											<h3>Courses</h3>
										</header>
										<p>The following are some of the most influential English courses that I've taken at St. Joe's:</p>
										<ul class="divided">
											<li><h4>Early American Literature:</h4> Focused on the way in which literature was shaped by (and helped to shape) the political landscape of the United States, from the landing of the Virginia Company to the abolition of slavery. </li>
											<li><h4>Critical Theories of Literature:</h4> Explored the practice of reading through the lens of prominent literary theories (psychoanalytic, feminist, reader-response, semiotics, etc.)</li>
											<li><h4>Writing for Organizations:</h4> In this course, I practiced a professional style of writing and composed business letters, reports, memos, and presentations. </li>
