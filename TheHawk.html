											<h2>The Hawk Newspaper</h2>
											<p>My experience and journalistic writing samples</p>
										</header>
										<p>
											The Hawk Newspaper is the organization I devote the most time to outside of the classroom. Working as an editor is demanding -- it's essentially a part-time job -- but it's also an invaluable learning experience. On the side of the page, you can view a sample issue of The Hawk as well as read the articles I have written for the paper. During my time at St. Joe's, I served in two roles on The Hawk: Copy Chief and Editor in Chief.
										</p>
										<header>
										<h3>Copy Chief</h3>
									</header>
									<p>I was Copy Chief of The Hawk during my freshman and sophomore years (2014-2015). As Copy Chief, I was responsible for editing each article that we published. I read each piece to check style, flow, and grammar as well as to ensure that it adhered to Associated Press (AP) Style. </p>
									<p>In this role, I also managed a team of about 10 copy editors. These editors served as a second pair of eyes on each article. I kept track of the flow of articles as they made their way through the copy system and ensure that each piece was ready for publication by production night. I enjoy reading the writing of others and doing what I can to make their ideas as clear and impactful as possible.  </p>
									<p> As Copy Chief, I also contributed to editorial discussions and decisions. By reading every article that The Hawk published, I quickly became familiar with the style of each of our sections. </p>
									<header>
									<h3>Editor in Chief</h3>
								</header>
								<p>In my junior and senior years (2016), I stepped into the role of Editor in Chief. In this position, I was responsible for everything that The Hawk published and every editorial decision that was made. My time as Editor in Chief was probably the most stressful period I experienced at St. Joe's, but it taught me a lot about myself and what I'm capable of as well as what it takes to run an entire publication.</p>
								<p>As the Editor of the paper, my day-to-day responsibilites included:</p>
									<ul class="editor">
										<li>Holding staff meetings</li>
										<li>Organizing digital media posts and giving input on digital strategy</li>
										<li>Communicating with our printing company</li>
										<li>Writing and editing articles</li>
										<li>Performing general administrative work</li>
										<li>Responding to questions from administrators</li>
										<li>Contributing to business decisions</li>
										<li>Selling ads</li>
										<li>Laying out pages in Adobe InDesign</li>
										<li>Overseeing the entire production process</li>
										</ul>
										<p> I learned to be flexible, reliable, and to address problems directly. As my faculty adviser once shared with me, "There are some things you learn best in calm, and some in storm" (Willa Cather). I could not have become a confident editor and leader without enduring the storm, and I'm happy to say that I came out (pretty much) alive.</p>
